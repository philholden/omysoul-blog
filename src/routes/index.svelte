  If you live in Edinburgh UK please put that in the location box and I will let
  you know about the first open air events. We will try to connect clusters of
  people in other areas.

  Once I have a guide for you to set up your free song server I will announce it
  in the newsletter. For the time being if you have comments or questions post
  them in the comments on the YouTube video.
