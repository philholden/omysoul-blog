<h1>What technology for worship and preaching on the street?</h1>

<img style="margin: 8px 0;width: 100%" src="/img/omysoul-tech-plain.svg" />

<p>
  Would you like a wireless, battery powered, set up for lyrics and
  presentations that you can take out onto the streets? I will describe a
  solution that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>can be set up in three minutes</li>
  <li>fits in a small backpack</li>
  <li>uses cheap off-the-shelf hardware and free software</li>
</ul>

<h2>Web technology</h2>

<p>
  The diagram at the top of the article gives the basic set up. For software we
  use web technology (HTML, JavaScript and CSS). Computers, phones, tablets and
  TVs often come with a web browser built in. Our app takes advantage of this
  and runs a brower full screen. The browser can then be used to display song
  lyrics and presentation slides (it can also be used to play audio and video).
  There will be another artical soon to describe how to set up the app. If you
  want to get the app early then sign up to the news letter below.
</p>

<p>
  In this set up most devices are set to be viewer devices (phones, TVs and
  projectors). They will all display the same lyrics or slides at the same time.
</p>

<h2>The presenter phone</h2>
<p>
  Normally one phone will be set up to be the presenter device. It controls
  which verse from a song, or slide from a presentation is displayed on all the
  other devices.
</p>
<img style="margin: 8px 0 0;width: 100%" src="/img/blueroom.jpg" />
<p>
  For a slide show the presenter phone also shows speaker notes between the
  slides. The preacher can control which slide is displayed next and also be
  reminded of what they intend to say.
</p>

<img
  style="max-width: 100%; width: 280px;display: block; margin: 24px auto"
  src="/img/phone-controller.jpg" />

<p>
  A very simple set up will consist only of phones connected to their normal
  mobile network (4G, 5G etc). One presenter phone controls what all the other
  phones see.
</p>

<p>
  This is nice because it works in daylight, nearly everone carries a smart
  phone in their pocket and nothing needs to be placed on the street. However a
  there are a couple of pieces of kit that make things a bit more interesting.
</p>
<p />

<h2>Projectors</h2>
<img
  style="margin: 24px 0;max-width: 100%;display: block;"
  src="/img/princess-street.jpg" />
<p>
  A phone only set up works well if you have a group that you can send a link to
  to in advance, but it is harder for passers by to join in. Somehow you need to
  explain to them to visit a website to see the lyrics. Using a projector allows
  passers by to join in straight away. The downside of a projector is that it
  only works after sunset.
</p>
<img
  style="max-width: 100%; width: 480px;display: block; margin: 48px auto"
  src="/img/projector.jpg" />
<p>
  In the video above I use a battery powered Android projector. The projector is
  basically like a phone or tablet but uses a projector instead of a screen. It
  has Wifi and Bluetooth and can download apps from Google Play. This means we
  can download Google Chrome on the projector. We can then set a phone to be a
  wireless hotspot and provide internet for projector. The lyrics app is a
  Persistant Web Application (PWA) this means it can be installed on the
  projector and gets its own icon to launch the app. The projector remembers
  Wifi passwords and Bluetooth pairings so you only need to set these up once.
  This enables you to do the whole set up in a couple of minutes.
</p>

<h2>Bluetooth speakers</h2>
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; margin: 32px 0;">
  <img
    style="width: 300px;max-width: 100%;display: block; margin: 0 auto"
    src="/img/speaker-white.jpg" />
  <img
    style="width: 300px;max-width: 100%;display: block; margin: 0 auto"
    src="/img/speaker-white.jpg" />
</div>
<p>
  I think its best to use human voices for singing on the street and to gather
  enough people that you make an impact (or even a few people with powerful
  voices). However a Bluetooth speaker or a pair of them can be useful for
  prayer meetings and home groups. You can pair these with your phone and set up
  a playlist and then use the lyrics app to display the lyrics. It feels really
  powerful to control both lyrics and music just from your phone.
</p>
<p>
  You can also use Bluetooth speakers on the street to give the audio for a
  presentation with slides. The street is a noisey place so you need to shout to
  be heard. However the more you raise your voice the less control you have over
  expression and internation. Street preachers can be hard to listen to because
  constant shouting sounds monotonous. If you pre-record a talk you can use you
  normal voice. You can speak gently, use your full range of expression and use
  the speakers to give the extra volume so others can hear. You can also say
  exactly what you intend to say (without rambling). You do not need to hold
  your talk in memory and you can share your talk with other groups to take out
  on the street.
</p>

<p>
  Android projectors also have their own memory this means you can download
  videos on them and can then pair the speakers to the projector. This allows
  you to have video with sound on the street. You can use this for testimonies
  and gospel presentations.
</p>

<h2>Sound recorder</h2>
<p>
  The last piece of kit which is very handy is a sound recorder. This can be
  used to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    pre-record audio for a presentation that will be played via a Bluetooth
    speaker on the street
  </li>
  <li>
    pre-record vocals and music and send to your group beforehand so they can
    practice independently
  </li>
  <li>
    to capture and share song ideas when composing music and writing songs
  </li>
  <li>
    to record songs when they are sung on the street as a the sound track for a
    youtube video
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If we can get great musicians out on the street, video the worship and upload
  to social media we create a positive feedback loop that will help gather more
  people out onto the street to worship. This video shows how a good musicians
  and a good sound recorder can make a compelling worship video on Youtube.

<p>
  Sound recorders are also helpful for capturing and sharing song ideas. Below
  is the story of how the songs of one rural Chinese girl sung into a dictaphone
  on her quiet time walks have fuelled the worship of millions in the revival in
  China.

<p>
  Jesus was clever about how he used technology. When the crowds got so tight
  they blocked people from seeing and hearing, he got into a boat and put a
  little distance between himself and the crowd. That way he could hold the
  attention of more people.
</p>
<p>
  If we are clever about how we use technology we can mobilise many believers to
  use their talents to proclaim the good news about Jesus to a destracted and
  dying world.
