<h1>About</h1>
Hi, I am Phil and I have a desire to see thousands of people worshiping and
teaching on the streets of towns and cities. I see such large crowds gather for
independence, pride and climate change so I figure it can't be impossible to see
large crowds gather in our age for Jesus too. I am hoping to connect with other
people around the world with the same desire.
<p />
I am a web developer and
<b>omysoul</b>
is a tool enable a crowd of people to see the same song lyrics on the screens of
mobile phones, TVs, tablets and projectors. The aim is to make organising open
air worship as effortless as someone posting on Twitter:
<p />
"I am heading to Bristo Square 5pm with a guitar who wants to join?"
<p />
Friends from various churches and different personal networks would join.
Between songs some people might give short exhortations and as they do this
Bible verses or pictures would appear on phone screens or be projected on walls.
As people pass a few believers from other churches stop and join the group and
find out what is going on. Contacts are exchanged and they join next time.
<p />
This is not meant to be a tool for carefully staged flash mobs but for open
worship where people learn new songs and passers by feel drawn to participate
not just spectate. Jesus wants worshipper that worship in Spirit and truth he is
not looking for a show. When we worship him we feel his presence and passers by
will too.
<p />
Some passers by might stop to listen to worship and perhaps respond to a
invitation for prayer for healing and end up getting saved too. Some might post
clips of songs, testimonies or teaching on social media. As this happens the
word spreads and each time more people gather. Jesus said if I am lifted up I
will draw all people to me.
<p />
So the hope is that in a city there might be several groups form different
churches worshiping at different times and different places with different
styles. Then every once in a while there is a kind of "Avengers Assemble" and we
all pull together and ship people in from surrounding towns and cities for a
crowd of thousands.
<p />
The modern Beltane Fire Festival start with just a small but determined group in
1988. With perseverance and creativity they have grown year by year to see
crowds of 10,000 people.
<p />
I think the hardest thing is finding the first twenty people. They don't care
about the weather, the dark, the cold, their lack of ability, the lack of free
coffee or their reputation. They just want to sing until they feel God's
presence and the fellowship of other believers. They know if they acknowledge
Jesus before men then he will acknowledge them on the last day before His father
and the angles.
<p />
If you want to join this you need a gather mentality (and this makes me feel
really uncomfortable). Because everyone that does not gather is actually
scattering. The act or not gathering teaches others not to gather. And this is
what we have been accidentally teaching each other in church, how to be OK with
not gathering.
<p />
I started this App over five years ago. I realise that Jesus is looking for
fruit on my tree. For you and I there is a work he had prepared in advance for
us to do. And we do not want him to say when he sees us:
<p />
"I have not found your deeds complete in the sight of my God."
<p />
So this is why I feel this year I need to run with what I have even if it is not
polished yet. It at least allows groups to see the same lyrics at the same time.
In following videos and articles I will show you how to set up a free song
server for your group.

<h2>Connecting</h2>
If you want to get involved please add comments to the video. Let people know
where you are from and any skills you might have. E.g.
<p />
worship leader, passionate worshiper, violinist, photographer, blogger, artist,
web developer, street outreach, pastor, social media.
<p />
If you are in Edinburgh please say. I will try to sort out a news letter sign up
and also put up a basic website. Subscribe to the channel as this will be where
you will hear the next news.
<p />
<h2>Technical</h2>
In the video above I used a cheap Â£239 Android projector. It is running a Chrome
browser and connected to my phone which is running as a wireless hotspot. The
lyrics app runs on the phone and on the projector and I can control the lyrics
on the projector via the phone with no cables. This set up is probably also very
handy for home groups.
<p />
In winter the projector image is very clear in the evening but in summer the
projector will be of little use outside. Then users will have to view lyrics on
phone screens. Winter will soon be over (in the north) so I am keen to see
people really run with this before evenings get too light. The projector is a
great way of gathering the initial crowd. Once enough people have downloaded the
app and know how it works you do not need the screen as much.
